# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This Python project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing transactional data, the project identifies high-value customers and provides insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, incorrect data types, and irrelevant or incorrect data entries.
   - Dropped rows with missing `CustomerID` (135,080 rows).
   - Retained rows with missing `Description` as they do not affect the RFM analysis.
   - Corrected `CustomerID` and `InvoiceNo` data types (from float to int).
   - Removed canceled orders (8905 rows with negative quantities or starting with "C").
   - Retained rows with 0 `UnitPrice` as they do not significantly skew the analysis.

2. **RFM Calculation**:
   - **Recency**: Days since the customer's last purchase.
   - **Frequency**: Number of purchases made by the customer.
   - **Monetary**: Total revenue generated by the customer.

3. **Segmentation**:
   - Customers are segmented into groups based on their RFM scores.
   - Provides actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Includes charts and graphs to visually interpret customer segments.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a transactional dataset from an e-commerce retail store. The data includes:
- `InvoiceNo`: Unique invoice number for each transaction.
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for customers.
- `Quantity`: Number of units purchased.
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit.
- `InvoiceDate`: Date of the transaction.

## Insights Gained
- Identification of the most valuable customers based on purchasing behavior.
- Segmentation of customers into actionable groups for targeted marketing.
- Insights into purchasing trends and customer loyalty.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Python in customer segmentation through RFM analysis. By leveraging transactional data, businesses can make informed decisions to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.
