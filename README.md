# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

## 🚀 Overview

This Python project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing transactional data, the project identifies high-value customers and provides insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🔄 Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values, incorrect data types, and irrelevant or incorrect data entries.
     - Dropped rows with missing `CustomerID` (135,080 rows).
     - Retained rows with missing `Description` as they do not affect the RFM analysis.
     - Corrected `CustomerID` and `InvoiceNo` data types (from float to int).
     - Removed canceled orders (8,905 rows with negative quantities or starting with "C").
     - Retained rows with 0 `UnitPrice` as they do not significantly skew the analysis.

2. **RFM Calculation**:
   - **Recency**: Days since the customer's last purchase.
   - **Frequency**: Number of purchases made by the customer.
   - **Monetary**: Total revenue generated by the customer.

3. **Segmentation**:
   - Customers are segmented into groups based on their RFM scores.
   - Provides actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Includes charts and graphs to visually interpret customer segments.
